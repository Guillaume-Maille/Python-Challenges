This is some basic code that I have worked on during my As level course in computer science as well as in my free time. 
This is heavily based on the "How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" online book which teaches you how to code with Python 3.

Some of the code here maybe be incomplete.
Some of these projects were done in collaboration with other students and friends.
